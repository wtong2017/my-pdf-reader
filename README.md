# My PDF Reader

## Motivation

Tracking references in PDF is somehow annoying. Some PDF provide links for readers to jump to the reference page. However, it is hard to refer back to the previous place. In this project, we aim at solving this issue by providing a checkpoint for readers to refer back. This project is built on [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/).

## Todo

- [x] Add refer back function
- [ ] Add pdf file basic functions

Are there any inconveniences or features that you want to add when viewing papers in pdf? For example, if you click the reference, you can't jump back.

1. What features do you want to add to PDF Reader?
   1. Summarization of each section
   2. **Jump back from the references/figures**
   3. Give brief introduction of entities (e.g., authors of the paper) when hovering + link to the definition appearing for the first time
   4. Give estimated time for reading the whole PDF file
   5. Others + verbal interaction to change annotation style (underline color...) + auto fix the text size and position of the annotation to avoid overlap + limit search range (searching in a book takes too much time)
2. What other apps do you want to link from PDF?
   1. Extract some texts to Word + text adapt to screen like in html
   2. Extract figures to Powerpoint
   3. Extract tables to Excel
   4. All
   5. Others
